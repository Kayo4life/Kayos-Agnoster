# Kayo's Agnoster


Hey there! This is a custom version of the Agnoster ZSH theme, designed for me, Kayo, to use.


It's mildly customized to fit my rice, mainly just to:

_1. Have a retro futuristic vibe

2. Follow my neon blue on black color scheme_


You will probably be fine using this, as Agnoster hasn't been updated in 6 years, but please note the following:
I will **not** be updating this repo with Agnoster unless I get an issue reported.


I hope you like it!
